                               (Geometry: area of a triangle)
					Stage one
1. prompt user to enter three points of triangle.
2. Display its area.
                                        Stage two
1. prompt user to enter point one.
2. collect point one.
3. store point one as "point1".
4. prompt user to enter point two.
5. collect point two.
6. store point two as "point2".
7. prompt user to enter point three.
8. collect point three.
9. store point three as "point3".
10. calculate the value of "s" using ( point1 + point2 + point3)/2.
11. store result as "s".
12. calculate value  using (s(s- point1)(s-point2)(s-point3)).
13. store result as "value".
14. calculate the area of triangle by finding the square root of "value".
15. store result as "area".
16. Display "area".
